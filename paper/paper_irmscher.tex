In century of digitalization there are many opportunities offered to perceive the self and own life in a different way as before. Self-tracking and quantifying is commonly used. Nowadays many people are engaging in self-tracking their body data. They are tracking the data, and also sharing these with other people, like friends or like-minded people. But there are many different types of data, which we can track. Such data like heartbeat or sleeping pattern does not seem to be too intimate when tracking and sharing, but how about data in intimate relationships and sexual behaviorism? In this work, the tracking and sharing of intimate data from our body or rather about our life will be considered. Therefore, the type of intimate data should be defined at first. What data is perceived as intimate and in what circumstances? Farther it will be investigate why people does tracking intimate data, and what they do with it. With whom do they sharing and discussing their intimate data? And finally, it will  be discussed if they over-trust this tracked data and how they perceive these.


\section{Related Work}
\cite{doi:10.1080/13691058.2014.920528} shows an critical analysis of a special type of digital health care device, such as self tracking technologies for tracking and sharing users sexual and reproductive activities and functions. Some of these smart phone apps available in the Apple App Store and also the Google play store are investigated of their sociocultural, ethical and political implications. It is show that such apps emerging ethical and privacy implications, and 

In \cite{doi:10.1080/15265161.2017.1409823} the research is focused on \ac{QR}. In this work a detailed ethical analysis is provided. They authors found eight core objections to \acs{QR} and investigated these critical. They found out that despite criticism, the \acs{QR} tracking technologies can be rated as helpful to support intimate relationships.

\subsection{What data is perceived as intimate? In what circumstances?}
This question can not be answered so easily. The perceiving what is intimate depends on several factors.
In general it has to be differentiated in the culture, how a human is perceiving the self and what is shaping the sociocultural live \cite{carrithers1985category}. It is not possible to consider all well-known cultures in this work, therefore the focus is limited on the scrutiny of the western world or rather civilization. 

In the western civilization the privacy takes up a lot of space. Nevertheless, the state of a person in the society is defining the personal perceiving of privacy and intimate data. And the personal view, as well.
These things can't be defined in a few sentences, the topic is to complex and not measurable. For the individual, intimate data are different.

Due to this, the definition of what is perceived as intimate for people living in the western civilization, will be shown by the following examples.

The dating app \textit{Tinder} is well known. It is used worldwide
