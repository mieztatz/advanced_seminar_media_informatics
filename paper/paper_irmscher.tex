%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
	% One or two sentences providing a basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.
	Self-tracking has become commonplace in the century of digitalization. People are tracking themselves or rather personal information. Moreover, they are storing and sharing this data. 
	
	% Two to three sentences of more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines.
	The Quantifying Self movement has inspired this trend. Today it is possible to track quantifiable data like heartbeat or sleeping pattern, but also "'not measurable"' data like moods, feelings and behaviors, which have a high intrinsic value. Such tracked data can be highly intimate, e.g. data of sexual and reproductive activities or intimate relationship. 
	
	% One sentence clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study.
	In this work, it is considered why people tracking themselves, and storing and also sharing such intimate data.
	
	% One sentence summarizing the main result (with the words “here we show” or their equivalent).
	
	% Two or three sentences explaining what the main result reveals in direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or how the main result adds to previous knowledge.
	
	% One or two sentences to put the results into a more general context.
	
	% Two or three sentences to provide a broader perspective, readily comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline, may be included in the first paragraph if the editor considers that the accessibility of the paper is significantly enhanced by their inclusion. Under these circumstances, the length of the paragraph can be up to 300 words. (This example is 190 words without the final section, and 250 words with it).

\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this work, different conditions in a relationship  were considered in which intimate data can be searched, collected tracked and shared.
Further, an attempt was made to formulate a definition for the term \textit{intimate data}. It also summarized how people perceive this data and how the data affects their perception.

For further work it is to investigate how partners in a well-functioning relationship perceive a mutual surveillance.
