\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conculsion}
%TODO: Summarizing the paper
In this work, different conditions in a relationship  were considered in which intimate data can be searched, collected tracked and shared.
Further, an attempt was made to formulate a definition for the term \textit{intimate data}. It also summarized how people perceive this data and how the data affects their perception.

%TODO: Provide all findings in a short sentence
%\subsection{RQ1: What data is perceived as intimate? In what circumstances?}
Intimate data arises predominantly from intimate activities, e.g. such sexual kind. Information about sexual preferences is also perceived as intimate. Fertility data, which is more prevalent in healthcare, is perceived as intimate, too. The view of what data is intimate may change, depending on the circumstances. Information shared with the partner until recently can quickly become intimate when the interpersonal relationship breaks down. A precise definition is therefore not so easy to find. What is intimate is partially perceived subjectively, and may be dependent on various circumstances.

%\subsection{RQ2: Why do people track intimate data in relationships?}
Technologies and devices are being used today to simplify processes. In the context of the technologies described above, one can conclude that these are used to obtain more information. In this way one can get to know oneself better, learn more about the body and the  own life. There is also the possibility to get in touch with others.

%\subsection{RQ3: What do they do with, e.g. tracking, storing, sharing and discussing and with whom?}
The collected data are evaluated in the own interest. In some cases, the data are also shared to benefit from the community, whose data are also available (big data science). The data is also shared to compare with others.

There is a possibility that only the data in the form of numbers are taken, and the intrinsic perception is lost.

%TODO: Own opinion, answering question from intro
The problem lies in the change in the conditions in everyday life.
In a romantic relationship a lot of information is shared over time, even those that are very intimate. This is important for the well-being of the relationship, because the trust is based on such shared facts. But at the same time providing such important intimate information provides a point of attack and gives power to the partner. Nevertheless, this does not means that it is better to hide such intimate information in a romantic relationship and build up relationships based on superficial communication.
Nevertheless it is sowed in several works, that abusing such intimate data and information is commonly used and possible. Due to this fact, more awareness for the own intimate data is needed, as well as the knowledge how to protect these data for abusing and disclosure, and how to protect oneself form being monitored by the partner or third parties.

%TODO: Future work
Condition \ref{subsec:D} includes considerations towards mutual voluntary surveillance in a romantic relationship. One fact by tracking the location of the partner constantly should be noticed in future works: It is questionable if the quantification of trust in romantic relationships is influencing the perception of the partners in the relationship, and in which way. Are location-based tracking device helpful for building trust in a relationship? How helpful are these informations for the partners? This should be considered in further works.
